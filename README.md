# [FiGoals-DEI](https://justinhdo.web.app/view_projects/figoals-diversity-equity-and-inclusion)

## **Our purpose**
The goal of this project is to enhance Corporate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts by improving transparency with our employee example data from Kaggle. Through data-driven insights and transparent communication, I aim to promote inclusivity and take proactive steps toward a more equitable and diverse workplace.

## **Description**
This project is a data-driven DEI initiative enhancing workplace transparency. Utilizing Kaggle datasets and Python Pandas Dataframes , I analyzed and crafted custom mailchimp mock-up pages. Visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn enhance inclusivity promotion with transparency. The website also outlined strategies for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion improvement.

## **Analysis**
I used certain fields/columns to analyze for my static website on mailchimp. I specifically focused on:
- Name
- Division
- Gender
- Minority
- Manger
- Ethnicity
- LGBTQ
- Disability

Once I came up with the numbers, I used DEI tactics to improve certain areas and became completely transparent on my Mailchimp website.

**NOTE:** This was for my CCNY DEI Final Assignment and the datasets are just mocked data from Kaggle
